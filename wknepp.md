## Clean Code Philosophy
- Program should read like instructions
- Function and variable names should be descriptive without concern for  brevity
- There should be no question as to what a function does based on its name
- Comments should be used sparingly. If the thought can be conveyed by rewriting code, do that
- Nesting should be kept to a minimum
