##  Background
I'm from Chattanooga, TN and lived there from kindergarten through highschool. I went to Notre Dame High School and played volleyball and basketball. Funny enough, the reason I got into comp sci was because my volleyball coach taught the class in high school, so I decided to take it for an easy A. Now here I am four years later still doing it...

##  Interests
- UT sports
- working out
- eating
- my cat
- beer

##  Comp Experience
I really don't have any experience outside of the courses I've taken so far at UT. I know C++ pretty well and have dabbled with Javascript and Python. Hopefully this semester I will begin to branch out and beef up my resume a bit.
