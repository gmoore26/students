## Background, Interests, HTML Link
- Background: I am from Morristown Tennessee and I grew up always loving computers. As soon 
as I could afford a laptop, I bought one to play video games. Then as I got older I wanted a desktop
so I built one for myself. I didn't take an interest in coding until I got to senior year of high school 
where I took AP computer science principles which had really basic code. 
- Interests: I like to play my instrument(clarinet), I enjoy coding personal projects(I am currently working on a web app), and I still 
occasionally play video games when I have time.
