I am a computer science major. I have various hobbies including,  

- Gaming
- Rollerblading
- Reading Comics
- Reading actual books  

I currently work at Chick fil A. I was homeschooled my whole life.  

I go to church at [West Park Baptist](https://westparkbaptist.org/) on Middlebrook pike.  

I mostly code in C++, but I have used Python, and assembly for school.  
I have done some lite UI design in visual studio, and I have used git.  
I am pretty familiar with redstone in Minecraft.
