## Background

I am a junior studying Computer Science with interests in cybersecurity. I am a Knoxville native, born and raised. I did not code prior to college but have always been interested in the workings of technology. 

## Interests

Outside of school, I enjoy baking. It is relaxing and helps to clear my mind. My favorite recipe is for muffins (<https://homecookedharvest.com/bakery-style-strawberry-muffins/#recipe>).
