# Background

I am a junior CS & Math student from Nashville, Tennessee. I've been interested in programming since my freshman year of high school. I learned a small amount of Python in an engineering class I was taking, and I've been hooked ever since. 

## Interests

My primary interest is **software engineering**, but I also am interested in web design and computer architecture. My non-computer related interests include gaming, music, and exploring nature.
