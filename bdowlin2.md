# CS340 Class Intro and Background

Brett Dowling | bdowlin2 | Brett-Dowling | Computer Science

## Background

Hello everyone, my name is Brett and I am a Junior here at the University of Tennessee. I am from the Nashville area
and more specifically Mt. Juliet if you are familiar with the area. This past summer I had an intership at Nissan, where I worked
in the Enterprise Architecture and Cloud COE teams. I am looking forward to an excellent semester ahead.

## Interests

One of my main interests is following Pro Baseball closely and following the advanced analytics and how they are created. Seeing
how the inclination of these numbers and how they correlate to success is facinating to me. One website that I follow closely is
called Baseball Savant which shows real time numbers while the games are currently going on live. Here is a link to that previously
mentioned website: [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com)
