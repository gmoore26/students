### background and interests

I am from Knoxville and love traveling, after graduation I do not want to live in knoxville. 
In my free time I live to go outside. It really doesn't matter what I do, sitting outside, playing sports, biking, doing hw. I love being outside, and I prefer cold seasons rather than hot seasons.

### Programming languages

The first languages I learned were html, css, and javascript. I learned these about 5 years ago and am not as good as I once was. I hardly know java from cs101 because why would I want to remeber that. I obv knox cpp, and have started to learn rust thanks to a friend encouraging me to. 
I am setting up a server on a raspberry pi at home using nodejs, currently deciding how I should host it.
