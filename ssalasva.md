## Background
My name is Sebastian Salas-Vaca and I was born in Ohio, then moved to Bolivia for a year, then lived in New Mexico, then Virginia, and now I'm here in Tennessee. I chose to study Computer Science in order to work in Software Engineering/Development so that I can solve problems and have fun solving them.
## Interests
I love playing soccer, it is my favorite athletic activity. Going along with that I also love watching soccer especially Champions League and the World Cup or any tournament really. I also love playing and making video games. Specifically I like playing first person shooters like Apex, Rainbow Six Seige, Call of Duty, etc.
