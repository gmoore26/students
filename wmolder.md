## Background
When I originally enrolled at UT, I was majoring in aerospace engineering. However, I changed it when, during my COSC 101 class, I realized that I liked working with computers more than I liked AE. Despite the fact that I am majoring in computer science, my end goal is to go to law school and become a patent attorney (and to become a patent attorney you need a STEM degree). As to why, I believe my personality and skills are best suited for a career as a lawyer as I quite like reading, writing, and arguing with people.
## Interests
* Making 3D models and Dioramas.

## Skills
I am familiar with C++, C#, and find assembly languages easy to learn and use. I have some experience with Unity but I don't particularly like making video games.
