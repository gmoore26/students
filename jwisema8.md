### My Background:
I have always loved computers, and I have always idolized Tony Stark. I didn't really get into programming until college, but I enjoy coding and hope to become one of the best software engineers in the area, and maybe even create the most advanced version of JARVIS yet.

### My Interests:
I love playing video games such as Satisfactory (my favorite!), Dead by Daylight, and Minecraft. I also enjoy riding my Suzuki motorcycle and hanging out with friends whenever possible!

### Familiar with:
- C++
- Java
- Python
