# About Me
I was born in India but moved to the States when I was very young, and I've spent my life since. I've always been drawn to computers and tech, and my father is also a computer scientist.

I love...
- Making music,
- Learning about machine learning,
- Spending time with my friends,
- Watching the 49ers

Making music is probably my favorite hobby out of everything. I use this AI powered stem isolater to isolate specific tracks, i.e the drum track or vocals, off of a song: https://vocalremover.org/next/
