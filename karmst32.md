Major: Computer Science

## Background
I am originally from [Memphis, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee), and I transferred to UTK after my first year of college at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. Before becoming a computer science major, I aimed to go to medical school, but my dreams have changed since then. Now, I would like to utilize my computer science degree to leverage a position in law to lay the groundwork for [AI regulation](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/en/magazine/271/eu-ai-regulation-artificial-intelligence-regulations) and overall tech policy improvements.

## Interests
My interests include the following:
- Reading
- Writing
- Video Games
- Crocheting

Additionally, I am particularly drawn to listening to true crime, which can be a bit morose, but it is fairly related to my future since I am enthusiastic about pursuing a law degree.
