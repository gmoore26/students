# About Me

- Name: Ro Neel
- NetID: hneel

- Major: Computer Science

# Background

Hello, I am a Knoxville native, and I grew up immersed in computers/programming since my father is a programmer. Majoring in Computer Science just felt like the natural choice for me. I once tried to be a Theatre major, hated it, and changed my major to Computer Science after the first semester.

# Interests

My interests include sewing, writing, doodling, and trying to learn Tagalog. [Tagalog Lite](https://languagecrush.com/book/3) is one of the best resources I have found and enjoyed, even compared to paid options. I also really enjoy [Tagalog.com](https://www.tagalog.com/) for the extensive dictionary and their flash card app that has built in audio for vocabulary.

# Languages

- C
- C++
- Python, but I hate it
- Dabbled in HTML5
