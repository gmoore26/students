## Interests
I am interested in cybersecurity, more specifically network security or cryptography. Outside of the computer sciecne world I like to be outdoors, whether that be rock climbing, hiking, running, or mountatin biking.

## Experience
I have used C++, Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Make, Bash, Next.JS, TypeScript but my proffitiancy in the software development languages and frameworks are very limited and I am very comfortble with the coding languages.
