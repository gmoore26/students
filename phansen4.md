## Background:
- From **Chattanooga TN**
- I am a Junior studying Computer Science at UTK. 
- Being form Chattanooga exposed me to the outdoors a lot so naturally that is what I love to do. Between activities outside, I used to spend a lot of time messing with my computer. This includes a variety of things from breaking apart old electronics, to learning basic coding in middle school. 
- This summer, I worked an internship doing cybersecurity in Oak Ridge. This was an awesome experience that showed me a lot of the behind the scenes of big deals that go down on the DOE side. 

## Interests:
1. I like to do anything outdoors. I love fishing and anything that relates. I also love going to sporting events, whether school related or not. 
2. I also love playing around with electronics. That can be anything from diy gadgets to building my own peripherals.
